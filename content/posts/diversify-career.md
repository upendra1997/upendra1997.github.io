I want to have a high impact from my career and and more I think about trying that, I feel that it cannot be done by simply following one field. 

I have been in computer science field for a while and have dabled in machine-learning/data-science on the side. All the jobs that I have taken were also aligned to the either fintech or logistics. But I feel that to have better impact on my career, I require cross pollination of different fields to mix-match different ideas from different fields and add value to whatever work I do.

I have been considering multiple future career/studiets that wish to pursue and there are few of the things that I have been interested in:
1. Working more closely to hardware, like: battery firmware, embedded systems, GPU programming, etc.
2. Learning more about biological world, and I feel that the way to step into it through learning it with something that I already know, like: https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics
3. I have been dabbling in machine-learning/data-science, and also have done multiple courses and certifications, but I never got to work on it full time; so having an opportunity there might also help me.
4. Working in civil services and seeing the issues the people and government faces and trying to help them with my experience in technology.
5. Starting my own business and growing it, which I think will teach me about lots of things like Delegating, Negotiating, Hiring, Execution, Finance, etc.
6. Working in Commerce and Finance to learn managing, saving and growing money and how technology can help in doing it better. For examle: https://zerodha.com/varsity/

I still feel like I can do more, learn more, help more and hope that I get to work in all kind of fields, businesses and situtations.
