I aim for a high impact career, and the more I contemplate this, the more I realize it cannot be achieved by sticking to one field alone.

I've been entrenched in the computer science realm for some time, with a side interest in machine learning/data science. While my past roles have mainly revolved around fintech or logistics, I believe achieving greater career impact necessitates cross-pollination across different domains, blending diverse ideas to enhance my work.

As I ponder various future career or study paths, several interests have caught my attention:

1. Delving into hardware intricacies, such as battery firmware, embedded systems, and GPU programming.
2. Exploring the biological world, potentially leveraging my existing knowledge through resources like https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics.
3. Expanding my involvement in machine learning/data science, transitioning from occasional dabbling to full-time engagement.
4. Venturing into civil services to address societal issues with my technological expertise.
5. Establishing and scaling my own business, offering insights into delegation, negotiation, hiring, execution, finance, and more.
6. Exploring commerce and finance to understand wealth management, savings, growth, and the role of technology, for instance, via platforms like https://zerodha.com/varsity/.

I remain eager to contribute more, learn more, and assist across various fields, industries, and scenarios.
