I am currently trying to learn various things like:
1. Rust
2. Haskell
3. Distributed Systems, ...etc.

To achieve this, I have been exploring various resources:
1. I have been delving into Alexis King's blog at [this link](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2021/03/25/an-introduction-to-typeclass-metaprogramming/) to gain a deeper understanding of typeclass metaprogramming.
2. I have attempted several challenges provided by [fly.io](https://fly.io/dist-sys/), some of which I have documented [here](https://github.com/upendra1997/maelstorm_rust).
3. I am referencing a list of papers mentioned in the course syllabus, available [here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html).
4. I am studying "A Top-Down Approach: Computer Networking" by Kurose & Ross.
5. I am exploring resources such as [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/) to deepen my understanding.
6. I am engaged in a [Functional Programming Course](https://github.com/upendra1997/fp-course).
7. I am utilizing resources from [Zerodha Varsity](https://zerodha.com/varsity/modules/).
8. I am also undertaking various "build-your-own" projects available at codecrafters.io, including:
   - [Redis](https://github.com/upendra1997/code-crafters-redis-rust)
   - [Docker](https://github.com/upendra1997/codecrafters-docker-rust)
   - and others.

I am navigating through this list based on my current interests, with the aim of completing it by the end of the year.
