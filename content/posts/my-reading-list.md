I am currently trying to learn various things like:
1. Rust
2. Haskell
3. Distributed Systems, ...etc.

and for this I have been readings different things:
1. I have been trying to read this blog by Alexis King: https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2021/03/25/an-introduction-to-typeclass-metaprogramming/ to understand more about typeclass metaprogramming.
2. Series of challenges by [fly.io](https://fly.io/dist-sys/). I have tried to complete few of them [here](https://github.com/upendra1997/maelstorm_rust)
3. A list of papers mentioned on the course: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html
4. A Top-Down Approach: Computer Networking by Kurose & Ross
5. [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/)
6. [Functional Programming Course](https://github.com/upendra1997/fp-course)
7. [Zerodha Varsity](https://zerodha.com/varsity/modules/)
8. Different build-your-own on https://codecrafters.io/
      1. [Redis](https://github.com/upendra1997/code-crafters-redis-rust)
      2. [Docker](https://github.com/upendra1997/codecrafters-docker-rust)
      3. ...etc.

and I have been jumping around this list depending upon my interests and I hope to complete it this year.
