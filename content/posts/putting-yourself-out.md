I have never been consistent with my writing and I wish to change it to become better at writing; and Internet is a place where we can express ourself. so this is me being accountable and putting myself out.


Now, I will be trying to write about:
1. daily-life
2. things I learned
3. explaining something
4. snippets
5. anything else


I will be trying to stick with it.
