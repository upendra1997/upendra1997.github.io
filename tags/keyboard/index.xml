      <description>My experience building for science keyboard</description>

<h2 id="journey">Journey</h2>
<p>While building the keyboard, I started with following the guide mentioned above, but It was not descriptive enough so I supplemented it with other guide for <a href="https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58/blob/master/Pro/Doc/buildguide_en.md">Lily58</a>.</p>
<p>While following the guide whenever I had doubts, I referred to the <a href="https://github.com/peej/for-science-keyboard/tree/master/gerber">gerber</a> file <a href="https://www.gerblook.org/">here</a>. It helped me to find which side was up by linking the TRRS jack and the pro micro&rsquo;s <code>D0</code> pin as mentioned <a href="https://golem.hu/article/pro-micro-pinout/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mistakes-i-made">Mistakes I made:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bad Soldering; Advice that I will give if you are new to soldering is to practie and make sure you can solder as mentioned on this <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/common-problems">blog</a>.</li>
<li>I soldered the <code>Pro Micro</code> chip, before soldering the switches. Which caused lots of issues as I tried to fix the mistake using desoldering pumps, desoldering wicks and flux. But in the end it didn&rsquo;t help and only damaged swithes and pro micro chip. Luckily I had spares swithes and few wires, so I sorted to them to make it work somehow. Lesson is to double/triple check components you are soldering, as desoldering is very painful and can damage components.</li>
<li>The TRRS cable that I had was faulty or I spoiled it, so had to get a new TRRS cable. Lesson would be to keep cheking connectivity of your ciruit with the gerber files using the <code>continuity mode</code> of Multimeter.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="issues-that-i-still-have-with-my-keyboard">Issues that I still have with my keyboard:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Right side doesn&rsquo;t work individually, i.e. if I connect the keyboard to the left split it works, but If I conncet using the right split, It doesn&rsquo;t. I tried this <a href="https://docs.splitkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010588860-Only-one-half-of-my-keyboard-works-at-a-time-but-not-when-they-are-both-connected">blog</a>, but It didn&rsquo;t help.</li>
<li>Sometime the whole keyboard hangs when I am typing and starts responding after sometime. My guess is that It is happening because of all the QMK features that I have <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/compare/master...upendra1997:qmk_firmware:master">enabled</a> on the keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="qmk">QMK</h2>
<p>I guess the QMK layout <a href="https://config.qmk.fm/#/for_science/LAYOUT_split_4x5_3">configuration</a> that they had was outdated and was not working properly with my keyboard, as I built the keyboard and tested them using <a href="https://config.qmk.fm/#/test">test-website</a>.</p>
<p>so I made few changes on my <a href="https://github.com/upendra1997/qmk_firmware">fork</a> to make them work, and added some extra layout and features, which suited my fancy.</p>
